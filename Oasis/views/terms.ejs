      <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
      <br><br>
      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <br>
      <p>We recognize that your privacy is important. This document outlines the types of personal
        information we receive and collect when you use OASIS, as well as some of the steps we take to
        safeguard information. We hope this will help you make an informed decision about sharing
        personal information with us. OASIS strives to maintain the highest standards of decency,
        fairness and integrity in all our operations. Likewise, we are dedicated to protecting our
        customers', consumers' and online visitors' privacy on our website.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Personal Information</h1>
      <br>
      <p>OASIS collects personally identifiable information from the visitors to our website
        only on a voluntary basis. Personal information collected on a voluntary basis may include
        names, addresses, and email addresses. Personal information received from any visitor will
        be used only for internal purposes and will not be sold or provided to third parties in any
        event.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Use of Cookies</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        We may use cookies to help you personalize your online experience. Cookies are identifiers
        that are transferred to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our
        systems to recognize your browser. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you
        have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize the sites pages, or register
        with any of our site's services, a cookie enables OASIS to recall your specific information on
        subsequent visits. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies by modifying your Web
        browser; however, if you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience
        the interactive features of the site. Browsers can be set to accept or reject cookies or
        notify you when a cookie is being sent. Taking this action shouldn't cause a problem with
        our site, should you so choose to do so.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h1>Children's Online Privacy Protection Act</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        This website is directed to adults; it is not directed to children under the age of 13. We
        operate our site in compliance with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, and will
        not knowingly collect or use personal information from anyone under 13 years of age.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Non-Personal Information</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not personally identifiable.
        We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to
        administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic
        information about our user base as a whole. The information collected is used solely for
        internal review and not shared with other organizations for commercial purposes.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Release of Information</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        If OASIS is sold, the information we have obtained from you through your voluntary
        participation in our site may transfer to the new owner as a part of the sale in order that
        the service being provided to you may continue. In that event, you will receive notice through
        our website of that change in control and practices, and we will make reasonable efforts to
        ensure that the purchaser honors any opt-out requests you might make of us.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>How You Can Correct or Remove Information?</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        We provide this privacy policy as a statement to you of our commitment to protect your
        personal information. If you have submitted personal information through our website and
        would like that information deleted from our records or would like to update or correct that
        information, you could do so by emailing our webmaster at royalray7@gmail.com.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <h1>Updates and Effective Date</h1>
      <br>
      <p>
        OASIS reserves the right to make changes in this policy. If there is a material change in our
        terms of service, we will indicate on our site that our terms have changed and provide a link
        to the new terms of service. We encourage you to periodically review this policy so that you
        will know what information we collect and how we use it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
